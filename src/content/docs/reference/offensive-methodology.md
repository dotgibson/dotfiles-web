# Offensive Methodology — the TTP map behind the tool layer

This is the "why" for `offensive/offensive.zsh` and `install/offensive-packages.txt`:
how the tools line up against a real engagement and against **MITRE ATT&CK**, which
is the through-line the whole industry (and adversary-emulation tooling like
Caldera) organizes around. It's a reference, not a runbook — every step is gated
on **written authorization and a defined scope**.

> Looking for the concrete, copy-paste command syntax per service/port? That's
> the field reference in [`offensive/hacktheplanet`](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Kali/blob/main/offensive/hacktheplanet) —
> this doc is the map, that file is the commands. (Symlinked to `~/hacktheplanet`
> by `bootstrap.sh`; `htp` opens it.) Companion field references sit at the
> same altitude: [`offensive/exploitdev`](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Kali/blob/main/offensive/exploitdev) (`xdev`) for binary
> exploitation, and [`offensive/evasion`](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Kali/blob/main/offensive/evasion) (`evade`) for AV/AMSI/
> AppLocker evasion and breaching hardened defenses. One altitude *up* — the
> working **method** that decides which command you reach for and what to do when
> you're stuck (the "always be running recon" loop, shell stabilization, the
> scripted pseudo-shell) — is [`offensive/ippsec`](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Kali/blob/main/offensive/ippsec) (`ipp`),
> distilled from IppSec's HTB catalog. The defensive mirror — what each attack
> trips, as Splunk/Sentinel detections — is in [`PURPLE-TEAM.md`](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Kali/blob/main/PURPLE-TEAM.md).

> Rule zero: `mkengagement` writes `scope/scope.txt` *before* anything else and
> opens it in your editor. Fill it in first. Installing a tool is not permission
> to point it at anything.

## The phase → ATT&CK → tool map

| Phase | ATT&CK tactic(s) | Go-to tools (this layer) | Workspace dir |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Recon** | Reconnaissance (TA0043) | amass, subfinder, dnsx, bbot, theharvester, masscan | `recon/` |
| **Scanning / enum** | Discovery (TA0007) | `nmapsweep`, nxc (smb/ldap/winrm), enum4linux-ng, ldapdomaindump | `scans/` |
| **Initial access** | Initial Access (TA0001) | nuclei/httpx/katana, ffuf/feroxbuster, sqlmap, Burp, responder | `web/`, `exploit/` |
| **Cred access** | Credential Access (TA0006) | nxc, impacket (secretsdump), responder, hashcat/john, certipy-ad | `loot/creds`, `loot/hashes` |
| **AD attack-path mapping** | Discovery / PrivEsc | **`bhce`** → BloodHound CE, bloodhound.py, SharpHound | `loot/bloodhound` |
| **Lateral movement** | Lateral Movement (TA0008) | nxc (exec over smb/winrm/mssql), impacket-psexec, evil-winrm | `notes.md` |
| **Privilege escalation** | Privilege Escalation (TA0004) | certipy-ad (AD CS), BloodHound paths, impacket | — |
| **C2 / persistence** | Command & Control (TA0011) | Sliver, Havoc, Metasploit, Caldera (emulation) | — |
| **Pivoting** | Lateral Movement | ligolo-ng, chisel, proxychains4, socat | — |
| **Reporting** | — | your notes + `logshell` transcript | `report/`, `notes.md` |

### The one naming change that bites people
**CrackMapExec is gone — it's `nxc` (NetExec) now.** CME was archived in 2023; the
community fork NetExec is the maintained successor and the single highest-leverage
tool in the kit: SMB / LDAP / WinRM / MSSQL / RDP / FTP / SSH auth, enumeration,
lateral movement, credential extraction, *and* BloodHound collection — one
scriptable interface. The old `crackmapexec`/`cme` muscle memory just becomes `nxc`.

### BloodHound is now BloodHound CE
The legacy BloodHound 4.x collectors don't cleanly ingest into Community Edition.
Use a **CE-compatible collector** — the `bhce` helper drives nxc's `--bloodhound`
module, which packages a CE-ready zip into `loot/bloodhound/`. Run BloodHound CE
itself from its official docker-compose (it's a Postgres-backed web app, not an
apt package).

## OPSEC / engagement hygiene baked into the layer

- **Scope first.** `scope/scope.txt` lists in-scope, out-of-scope, the auth
  reference, the time window, and an emergency "stop" contact. If it's blank,
  you're not ready to run.
- **Everything in `~/engagements`, never in the repo.** `$ENGAGEMENTS_DIR` lives
  outside any git tree; the Kali repo's paranoid `.gitignore` is only a backstop.
  Client data in a public showcase repo is a career-ender.
- **Audit trail.** `logshell` records a `script(1)` transcript into the
  engagement's `notes/` so you can reconstruct exactly what you ran and when —
  for the report and for deconfliction. `note "<text>"` adds timestamped
  observations to `notes.md` as you go (IppSec's note discipline — see
  [`offensive/ippsec`](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Kali/blob/main/offensive/ippsec)): capture every state change, cred, and
  host the instant it happens so the report writes itself.
- **WSL2 gotcha (already in PORTING-MATRIX).** A listener / reverse shell in Kali
  under WSL2 isn't reachable from your LAN until you set
  `networkingMode=mirrored` in the **Windows-side** `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`
  (Win11 22H2+) — not `/etc/wsl.conf`. Bites every Sliver/Responder/C2 setup.

## What I deliberately did NOT put in the repo

- No payloads, implants, shellcode, or exploit code. Those are generated
  per-engagement, live in `exploit/` under `~/engagements`, and never sync.
- No target lists, creds, or loot. Same reason.
- Sliver / Havoc / Caldera are install *pointers*, not vendored — they move fast
  and carry their own update cadence.

The dotfiles job is to make the **toolset and workspace** reproducible across
boxes. The tradecraft stays in your head and in the (private, out-of-repo)
engagement notes.
