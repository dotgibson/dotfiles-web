description: The per-distro lookup that stamps Arch, openSUSE, Alpine, Gentoo, and Debian from the Fedora template — package managers, package names, clipboard backends, and quirks side by side.

<!--
  MIRROR — everything below this comment is a verbatim copy of
  dotfiles-core/PORTING-MATRIX.md at its LATEST RELEASE TAG, which is the
  canonical source. The ref matters: data-freshness.yml diffs this page against
  `contents/PORTING-MATRIX.md?ref=<releases/latest>`, NOT against Core's main.

  So: do NOT hand-edit the body here, and do NOT mirror from Core's main —
  lagging main while matching the newest release is CORRECT, not drift. Mirroring
  main's content here turns a green check red until that work is released.

  To update: fix it in Core and wait for the release that carries the fix. The
  fleet-sync bot re-mirrors this page on the same sweep that refreshes the four
  generated data files, so it normally lands without anyone touching it. To do it
  by hand — or to check first — run:

    npm run mirror              # rewrite the body from the latest release
    node scripts/mirror-porting-matrix.mjs --check   # what CI asks

  Both are the same script, which is also what data-freshness.yml's
  porting-matrix-mirror job runs, so a local run and CI cannot disagree.

  This page had silently rotted to a pre-v4.x snapshot once (it named packages
  that don't exist), and was once "fixed" by mirroring main, which broke the
  check the other way — hence the emphasis on the ref. It rotted a second time
  the moment Core cut v4.14.1, which is what prompted automating the copy rather
  than only checking it. dotfiles-core's /doc-audit routine cross-checks the two
  weekly, against the tag.

# Distro Porting Matrix

How to stamp `dotfiles-Arch`, `dotfiles-openSUSE`, `dotfiles-Alpine`,
`dotfiles-Gentoo`, and `dotfiles-Debian` from the `dotfiles-Fedora` template. The structure is identical
every time — only three things change per distro: **package manager commands**,
**package names**, and **distro quirks**. Core never changes (it's vendored).
Offense (Kali) and macOS appear in the reference tables below for convenience, but
they're their own lineages — built directly, **not** stamped from this template (see
_Repo status_ at the bottom).

## Per-repo recipe

1. `cp -r dotfiles-Fedora dotfiles-<Distro>`
2. Rename `os/fedora.zsh` → `os/<distro>.zsh`; swap clipboard + pkg-manager aliases.
3. Replace `install/packages.txt` with that distro's names (table below).
4. In `bootstrap.sh`: swap the `dnf` block for the distro's installer and the
   `/etc/os-release` guard string.
5. `git subtree add --prefix=core <dotfiles-core> main --squash`
6. Update the README's "specifics" section to that distro's quirks.

¹ openSUSE: in Tumbleweed main OSS as `tealdeer` (1.8.0). **Not in Leap 16.0 or 16.1** —
it shipped in 15.6, which is EOL, and the name is absent from both arches of each 16.x
`repo/oss` (checked 2026-08-21). Two ways in on Leap: the `utilities` OBS repo, which does
build it (`.../repositories/utilities/16.0/x86_64/tealdeer-1.8.0-lp160.49.8.x86_64.rpm`) but
is a third-party channel `dotfiles-openSUSE` deliberately does not auto-add, same call as
Packman; or `cargo install --locked tealdeer`, which its `bootstrap.sh` now runs
presence-guarded. Guard on **`tldr`**, not `tealdeer` — the crate and the binary it installs
have different names (dotfiles-openSUSE#102).
² Alpine default shell is `ash`; you must `apk add zsh` explicitly.
³ Not packaged or stale → bootstrap.sh installs it best-effort (upstream
installer / `cargo install` / `go install` / AUR), the same pattern bootstrap
already uses on Fedora. Add `cargo`/`rust` (or a `go` toolchain) to packages.
`go install` targets land in `~/.local/bin` via `GOBIN` so they're on PATH.
**`carapace` is the one documented exception to the `go install` half of this** — that
module can never be `go install`ed, on any platform, so its cells point at ²⁷ instead.
The module path is rarely the repo URL — see ³¹ for the exact one per tool.
⁴ Debian/Kali ship these under different binary names — `bat` runs as `batcat`,
the `fd-find` package installs `fdfind`, and the `du-dust` package installs the
`dust` command. Core's `00-tools.zsh` already resolves them, so aliases and config
work unchanged. `20-aliases.zsh` additionally aliases `bat`/`fd` back to their
canonical names, so both are typeable as documented upstream, and `core-doctor`
probes the RESOLVED binary — it reports `✓` for a renamed tool rather than the `✗`
that once contradicted the `resolved` line in the same report.
⁵ nvim-treesitter (pinned to `main`) needs tree-sitter-cli ≥ 0.26.1. **Mac:**
`tree-sitter-cli` via brew — **not** `tree-sitter`, which is now lib-only.
**Fedora:** `tree-sitter-cli` via dnf (verify ≥ 0.26.1, else mise/cargo).
**Arch:** `extra` carries 0.26.9 (clears the floor). Where unpackaged:
`mise use -g tree-sitter` or `cargo install tree-sitter-cli`. On **Alpine** the
`community` package **is** the musl build (0.26.7, clears the floor) — prefer it
over cargo/any prebuilt binary.
⁶ yq: this matrix targets **mikefarah's Go `yq`** (the jq-for-YAML). Distros also
ship **Python `yq`** (kislyuk) under the same `yq` name; if you land the wrong
one, install the Go build via `mise use -g yq` or the upstream release binary.
On **openSUSE** the main OSS `yq` is the kislyuk **Python** build (the Go build
only ships from a personal OBS repo), so `dotfiles-openSUSE` go-installs the
mikefarah build in `bootstrap.sh` (`go³`) rather than packaging the wrong `yq`.
⁷ shfmt: not always in stable apt (Debian/Kali), and **not packaged on Gentoo** —
absent from `::gentoo` and from GURU (third-party overlays carry it as
`dev-util/shfmt`; there is no `dev-go/shfmt` atom), so Gentoo takes the `go²¹`
path — and there, unusually for a ²¹ row, `bootstrap.sh` **does** install it:
`dotfiles-Gentoo` go-installs shfmt unconditionally alongside gron and sesh,
because nvim's conform formatter is wired to it. If the package is missing,
`mise use -g shfmt` or `go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest`. (These mid-2026 rows are
best-effort — verify the exact package on first stamp of each distro.)
⁸ jujutsu (jj): OPT-IN, additive git companion — never replaces git, so a box
without it just skips the HAVE_JJ-gated aliases. Packaged on Arch (`jujutsu`),
openSUSE (`jujutsu`), Homebrew (`jj`), nixpkgs (`jujutsu`) and Alpine
(`community` — a native musl build), and **on Gentoo as `dev-vcs/jj`** — mind the
name, the atom is `jj`; `dev-vcs/jujutsu` has never existed and is the trap this
row used to fall into. Added 2025-12-04 (`dev-vcs/jj: new package, add 0.36.0`,
EAPI 8, maintainer `chutzpah@gentoo.org`); every ebuild is `~amd64` with no stable
version, so it needs a `package.accept_keywords` line. **Not** in stable
Debian/Kali apt and **not on Fedora** — `dnf` has no `jujutsu`, `jj` or `jj-cli`
on F43/F44/rawhide and no retired build to point at, unlike `sd`/`gron` which
were dropped — so those two take `cargo install --locked jj-cli`, the same cargo
pattern as yazi/ouch. The crate is **`jj-cli`**, not `jujutsu`: the `jujutsu`
crate is a stub pinned at 0.7.2 whose own description reads "You don't want this
crate - you want the `jj-cli` crate", so `cargo install jujutsu` lands a redirect
rather than the VCS — a second reason to spell it `jj` on both packaging paths.
As an opt-in tool it is carried in exactly one OS repo's `packages.txt` —
`dotfiles-Alpine` (package `jujutsu`, binary `jj`). Arch lists it only as a
commented opt-in you run by hand. **Gentoo installs it, but not from
`packages.txt`**: that file is the UNCONDITIONAL emerge, and an atom there would
land on a `--no-extras` run, so `bootstrap.sh` emerges `dev-vcs/jj` from its
opt-in extras block instead (`scripts/check-packages.sh` check 7 gates the
hard-coded atom). Read the absence from Gentoo's list as a deliberate placement,
not a decline. The config (`jujutsu/config.toml`) is inert without the binary.
⁹ sesh: smart tmux session manager that Core already drives from the `Ctrl-G`
shell widget (`35-fzf.zsh`) and the `prefix + f` tmux popup (`tmux-sesh.sh`); both
degrade to a `find`+`fzf` sessionizer when it's absent. `core-doctor` already
reports `sesh` via its own `command -v` probe (it does not read `HAVE_SESH`);
`00-tools.zsh` now also sets `HAVE_SESH` for parity with the other detected tools.
Packaged in the AUR as `sesh-bin` (which
`provides`/`conflicts` `sesh`, so `paru -S sesh` still resolves — there is no
AUR package under the bare name), Homebrew
(`sesh`), and nixpkgs (`sesh`); **not** in Arch-official, openSUSE, Alpine,
Gentoo, Fedora, or Debian/Kali apt — so most of the fleet uses
`go install github.com/joshmedeski/sesh/v2@latest` (note the **v2** module path),
the same build path as starship/yazi/atuin where unpackaged. `go` is already a
pinned mise runtime, so the install works everywhere; `mise use -g go` first on a
bare box. The seeded `sesh/sesh.toml.example` config is inert without the binary.
¹⁰ difftastic (`difft`): OPT-IN structural/AST diff — a **companion to delta, not a
replacement**. delta stays the default `git diff` pager; difft is wired as an on-demand
git difftool (`git dft`, and the `gdft` shell alias — see `git/gitconfig`), never as a
`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`/pager override, so it never shadows delta. Binary is `difft` (Core
sets `HAVE_DIFFT`). Packaged on Arch (`extra`), Alpine (`community` — a musl build, so the
usual outlier is covered), Fedora, Gentoo (`dev-util/difftastic`), openSUSE, Homebrew
(`difftastic`) and Debian/Kali apt; where unpackaged, `cargo install difftastic` or `mise`.
Inert without the binary — the `gdft` alias is `HAVE_DIFFT`-guarded and `git dft` just errors.
¹¹ ast-grep: OPT-IN AST-aware structural search/rewrite — the syntax-tree complement to
`ripgrep` (text), `sd` (regex), and `gron` (JSON). Core adds **no alias** (like `gron`/`sd`) — but
the crate installs a SECOND binary, `sg`, and **that name is already taken**: `sg(1)` is a symlink
to `newgrp`, shipped by `login` on the Debian family and by `shadow` elsewhere. Since #425 put
`${CARGO_HOME:-~/.cargo}/bin` on PATH ahead of `/usr/bin`, a `cargo install`ed ast-grep now WINS
that lookup, so a bare `sg` runs the search tool rather than switching group. Prefer the `ast-grep`
name, and reach the real one as `newgrp` (or `/usr/bin/sg`). This footnote used to say `sg` "can
collide with `setgroups`" and that ast-grep "shadows nothing" — both were wrong, and #425 turned
the second into a live shadow rather than a hypothetical one. Core sets `HAVE_ASTGREP` when
present. Packaged on Arch (`extra`) and Alpine (`community` — a musl build, so the outlier is
covered) and Homebrew; elsewhere via `cargo install ast-grep` / `mise` / `npm` / `pip`. Inert
without the binary — nothing depends on it.
¹² Gentoo **GURU overlay** (`sd`, `glow`, `xh`, `carapace`, `1password-cli`, `tealdeer`,
`yazi`, `lazygit`, `direnv`, `gping`¹⁹): not in the main `::gentoo` tree. Enable once with
`eselect repository enable guru && emaint sync -r guru`, then `emerge` the atom. bootstrap.sh
does this best-effort, per-atom (one masked atom doesn't block the rest), in its `guru_install`
pass — which runs AFTER the main-tree emerge, so these must not sit in the main `packages.txt`
blocks or they're skipped. They are named in a `packages.txt` comment instead, which is a
**pointer to that call, not a decline** — bootstrap really does emerge them. direnv is
`app-shells/direnv` (not `dev-util/direnv`, which does not exist). **`gum` is not on this list
and must not be added back**: `app-misc/gum` exists in neither GURU nor `::gentoo` (nor as
`app-shells/gum` or `dev-util/gum`), so an entry can only ever emerge as a `skipped:` line —
which reads like a keyword mask and gets "fixed" with an `accept_keywords` entry that unmasks
nothing. That is exactly how it survived in `guru_install` for months; see ³⁰ for what provides
gum on Gentoo now.
¹³ op = **1Password CLI**. bootstrap.sh installs it from 1Password's official **signed** repo,
which differs per family: dnf/rpm repo (Fedora/openSUSE), apt repo (Debian/Kali), apk repo
(Alpine — a native musl build, so it's fine on the musl outlier), the AUR `1password-cli`
(Arch), and the GURU `app-misc/1password-cli` (Gentoo). A vendor repo, **not** the OS repo;
the apt/rpm setup is rollback-safe (a failed install removes the added repo entry).
¹⁴ Alpine **testing** repo (`duf`, `glow`, `ouch`): musl-fine tools that live in `testing` (never
promoted to `community` on stable, incl. 3.24), which isn't enabled by default on a stable
release. bootstrap.sh builds them from source instead of force-enabling `testing`, and the two
paths are **not** the same one: `duf` + `glow` take `go install` (static, musl-safe), while
`ouch` takes `cargo install --locked ouch --no-default-features` — bzip3's `libbzip3-sys` build
script runs bindgen, bindgen `dlopen`s libclang, and Rust's musl toolchain links statically, so
the DEFAULT feature set cannot build on the outlier at all (installing clang does not help).
None of the three is listed in `install/packages.txt`, and putting them there "as a best-effort"
is a **footgun the OS repo documents against**: `apk` fails the whole transaction on one unknown
name, so a permanently-unresolvable entry breaks the bulk `apk add` on EVERY run and forces the
per-package retry loop across the entire list.
¹⁵ Kali `glow`/`gum`: recent **Debian sid** packages (Kali rolling tracks testing/sid). If they
haven't migrated to your snapshot, bootstrap falls back to `go install` / the Charm apt repo
(`repo.charm.sh/apt`).
¹⁶ viddy: the `watch` replacement — Core aliases `watch`→`viddy` (`HAVE_VIDDY`-guarded in
`zsh/20-aliases.zsh`), so a box without the binary just keeps classic `watch`. viddy is a
**Rust** CLI (rewritten from Go upstream), so it installs via `cargo install viddy`, **not**
`go install`. Packaged on Homebrew (`viddy`, already in the macOS `Brewfile`) and the AUR;
**not** in Arch-official, Gentoo, or Debian/Kali apt, but now in **Alpine**
`community` (a native musl build — apk-installed, with the cargo build kept as a fallback)
and **openSUSE** Tumbleweed `repo-oss` (see ¹⁸).
Where unpackaged, `bootstrap.sh` builds it best-effort via `cargo install --locked viddy`
(the same cargo path as yazi/dust/tealdeer). **Arch** is the exception: it ships no rust toolchain and builds no AUR
helper (see its `packages.txt`), so bootstrap prints a hint to `paru -S viddy` instead of
auto-installing. Inert without the binary.

¹⁷ jnv: OPT-IN interactive jq-filter editor + collapsible JSON viewer — the "explore an
unfamiliar API/JSON response" verb, complementing `jq` (transform), `gron` (grep), and `yq`
(YAML). Its own command (no alias, like `jq`/`gron`/`ast-grep`), `HAVE_JNV`-guarded in
`zsh/00-tools.zsh`, inert without the binary. A **Rust** CLI (embeds `jaq`, so no external
`jq` needed). **On Linux this is detect-only — unlike the ³ tools, `jnv` is in no
`install/packages.txt` and no `bootstrap.sh` installs it, so Core lights up `HAVE_JNV` only
once you install it yourself. macOS is the exception: the `Brewfile` carries it.** The cells above name where each platform gets it when you opt in —
macOS `brew install jnv`, Arch `pacman -S jnv`, Nix, or elsewhere `cargo install --locked
jnv` (musl-safe on Alpine) — not an automatic install. **Arch's cell used to read `AUR` and
this footnote used to prescribe `paru -S jnv`; both are now wrong.** jnv entered `extra` as
0.7.1-1 on 2026-04-01, confirmed on-box with `pacman -Si jnv` (`Repository: extra`), so no AUR
helper is involved on Arch any more. Wiring it into the per-repo bootstrap
(the ³ best-effort path viddy/yazi use) is a tracked follow-up in the OS repos; there is
no confirmed Gentoo GURU atom yet either, so verify on the next Gentoo stamp.

¹⁸ openSUSE **Tumbleweed** now ships these first-class in the main OSS **binary** repo
(`repo-oss`, i.e. `.../tumbleweed/repo/oss` — built from OBS `openSUSE:Factory`; note
`src-oss` is the _source_-RPM repo and is not what `zypper in` resolves against), so
`zypper in` beats the upstream-installer/cargo/go fallback these rows used to prescribe:
`starship`, `atuin`, `yazi`, `viddy`, `ouch`, `doggo`, `ast-grep`.
**Leap 16.0 and 16.1 have now been audited** (dotfiles-openSUSE#89, verified against both
releases' `repo/oss` binary indexes on 2026-08-21) — the supported Leap is 16.x; 15.6, which
this note used to hedge about, is EOL. **All seven resolve on both**, via Backports rather
than the main OSS repo — `starship` 1.21.1, `atuin` 18.3.0, `yazi` 25.5.31, `viddy` 0.4.0,
`ouch` 0.5.1, `doggo` 1.0.5, `ast-grep` 0.28.0 (`bp160`/`bp161` disttags). So `zypper in`
is the right first move on Leap too, and the ³ fallback is no longer the expected path for
these seven — but Leap pins where Tumbleweed rolls, so treat those versions as a floor and
take the ³ path when a row needs something newer. The rows are named for Tumbleweed because
that's the flavor this fleet targets.
Five of the seven (`starship`, `atuin`, `yazi`, `viddy`, `doggo`) are also installed by
`dotfiles-openSUSE`'s `bootstrap.sh`, which stays correct and harmless either way — each
install is presence-guarded, so a packaged binary just short-circuits it. **`ouch` and
`ast-grep` are not**: that bootstrap has no installer for them, so the old `cargo³` cells
promised a fallback that never existed and the package name above is their only automatic
path. Moving any of these into `install/packages.txt` is a separate judgment call — it trades
upstream-latest for the distro build. **`dotfiles-openSUSE` has since made that call the other
way**: its list flipped to packaged-first, and `starship`, `atuin` and `yazi` are now in it, so
the three `curl | sh` installers only run as a fallback. `viddy` deliberately stays out (cargo,
for upstream-latest). For `ouch`/`ast-grep` the package name is still the _only_ way to get them
installed without doing it by hand.

¹⁹ gping: the `ping` replacement — Core aliases `ping`→`gping` (`HAVE_GPING`-guarded in
`zsh/20-aliases.zsh`), so a box without the binary just keeps classic `ping`. **Detect-only on
every Linux repo except `dotfiles-Alpine` and `dotfiles-Gentoo`** — Alpine's
`install/packages.txt` carries `gping` outright, and Gentoo emerges `net-analyzer/gping` from
GURU in its `guru_install` pass. Gentoo's list names the atom only in a comment because
overlay-only atoms **must** live there (the main-tree emerge runs before GURU is enabled, so an
atom in the list proper would be skipped and never retried) — that comment is a pointer to the
call, **not** a decline, which is what this footnote used to read it as. The macOS `Brewfile`
carries it too. On the other seven repos the alias lights up only once you install it yourself —
this row exists so there is a documented path when you do. (`aliases.md` and `PARITY.md` have advertised the alias since
v3; the matrix row is what was missing.) A **Rust** CLI → `cargo install gping` anywhere
unpackaged. Packaged: Arch `extra`, Alpine `community` (a native musl build, so the outlier is
covered), Homebrew (`gping`), nixpkgs, and Debian/Kali apt — where the **source** package is
`rust-gping` but the **binary** you install is plain `gping` (Debian trixie 1.19.0, sid/Kali
rolling 1.20.4). openSUSE: **Leap 16.0 and 16.1** both carry it via Backports at 1.17.3
(`gping-1.17.3-bp160.1.13` / `-bp161.1.6`, verified 2026-08-21) — behind, but present without
adding a repo; **Tumbleweed** builds it from Factory (1.20.1). The old 15.6/1.16.1 reading
here predated Leap 16 and 15.6 is now EOL. Gentoo is **GURU-only** (`net-analyzer/gping`) — there
is no main-tree atom, so it is emerged **like the ¹² atoms**, in the same `guru_install` pass and
from the same overlay; nothing there is left for you to do by hand. Inert without the binary;
nothing depends on it.

²⁰ atuin **daemon mode** — the one part of the atuin story that is NOT Core's to decide.
Core ships `atuin/config.toml` (symlinked to `~/.config/atuin/config.toml`) with the
`[daemon]` block **off**; the daemon owns the SQLite writes so shells stop contending for
the DB lock, which is where atuin's tail latency comes from on a busy multi-pane box. What
differs per machine is how the daemon gets **launched**, so that half lives in the OS repo:

| Machine                                                              | How the daemon runs                                                                                                                                                                                                              | What the OS layer exports                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fedora✔ · Debian/Ubuntu✔ · Arch · openSUSE · Gentoo (systemd) · Kali | `systemd --user` unit — copy `examples/atuin-daemon.service` into `~/.config/systemd/user/`, then `systemctl --user enable --now atuin-daemon` (and `loginctl enable-linger $USER` if you want it alive outside a login session) | `ATUIN_DAEMON__ENABLED=true`                                  |
| Alpine✔ (musl, no systemd)                                           | atuin supervises its own daemon — no unit, no service manager, nothing to install                                                                                                                                                | `ATUIN_DAEMON__ENABLED=true` + `ATUIN_DAEMON__AUTOSTART=true` |
| macOS                                                                | same as Alpine: `autostart` beats hand-writing a launchd plist, and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset there so the socket lands in the data dir — which atuin resolves itself                                                           | `ATUIN_DAEMON__ENABLED=true` + `ATUIN_DAEMON__AUTOSTART=true` |
| Windows                                                              | out of scope — `dotfiles-Windows` vendors no `core/` and replicates its host config in PowerShell                                                                                                                                | —                                                             |

The exports belong in that repo's `os/<os>.zsh` (loader fragment 80), **never** in the Core
config: Core is vendored identically to every repo, so a per-machine value there would be
wrong on the other eight. `autostart` is mutually exclusive with `systemd_socket = true` —
pick the unit or pick autostart, not both.

**✔ marks the machines where the exports are actually wired today — Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu
and Alpine, three of the eight Core-vendoring machines this table covers.** The marker is
per **machine**, not per row: the systemd row holds a wired Fedora and a wired
Debian/Ubuntu alongside four unwired ones. For the other five — Arch, openSUSE, Gentoo and
Kali (sharing that row with Fedora) plus macOS — the cell is the documented recipe, not a
shipped state, so follow the rollout order below (Fedora first as the template, Alpine
second as the design's real constraint, then the rest) rather than assuming your repo
already does this.

`dotfiles-Debian` is wired end to end: its `os/debian.zsh` exports `ENABLED`, and — because
Ubuntu **has** systemd, so the `AUTOSTART` fallback never fires there — its `bootstrap.sh`
also installs and enables the `systemd --user` unit. Exporting `ENABLED` without installing
a launcher is the one state this note warns against, and on a systemd box the autostart
escape hatch does not cover for it. The `Windows` row is neither wired nor pending:
it is out of scope, vendoring no `core/` at all. **`Defense` has no row here by design** —
it is distro-agnostic and carries no `os/` layer, so its atuin exports come from whichever
OS repo is underneath it (see "Repo status"). Eight machines + `Defense` = the nine
Core-vendoring repos in `scripts/os-repos.txt`.

**For those exports to work at all, `atuin/config.toml` must leave `enabled` and `autostart`
unset** — and it does. atuin builds its config as defaults → environment → config **file**,
with the file source added last, so in the `config` crate the file WINS: any key written
there shadows its `ATUIN_*` override. Core previously wrote `enabled = false` explicitly,
which silently made every export in this table a no-op — measured against atuin 18.19.0, the
client made zero `connect()` calls to the daemon socket with the key present and one with it
absent. Upstream's defaults are already `false`, so leaving the keys out ships the same OFF
default while letting the override through. `scripts/test-core.sh` asserts they stay out. Adoption order is Fedora first (the template the
Linux repos are stamped from), Alpine second (it is the design's real constraint, so proving
it early is worth more than doing it last), then the rest.

Under the **systemd-unit** launcher, `zsh/00-tools.zsh` probes the socket before the first prompt
and then, throttled to at most one `connect(2)` a minute, for the life of the shell, forcing the
daemon **off for that shell** the first time a connect fails: an absent — or stale, i.e. left
behind by a crashed daemon — socket does not cost atuin a failed write, it costs the row. So a
dead daemon costs the lock relief, not your history — including for a session that was already
open when the daemon went away, which is the case the one-shot probe used to miss entirely
(`dotgibson/dotfiles-core#366`). Degradation is **one-way**: the guard unhooks itself and never
re-enables, because direct writes always work, so the only price of being early is the lock relief
until the next shell. A shell that was **already** degraded when it started stays silent — nothing
changed under it — while one whose daemon died **mid-session** prints a single warning, that being
the case where an open session's plumbing changed underneath it. `core-doctor` distinguishes the
two afterwards, and `core-doctor --json` exposes them as `atuin_daemon.degraded` / `.was_up`.
`CORE_ATUIN_PROBE_INTERVAL` tunes the window for a box where `connect(2)` on that path is not
cheap. One wrinkle worth knowing: the disable is an `export` (that is how it reaches the `atuin`
binary), so a shell started _from_ a degraded shell inherits `ATUIN_DAEMON__ENABLED=false` and
stands down as "never opted in" — harmless, since it also writes directly, but it will not pick
the daemon back up until you start a shell from a clean parent.

**Under `autostart` the probe deliberately does not run** — and that is the Alpine and macOS
rows above, so on two of the eight machines this safety net is not the thing keeping you out
of trouble. It stands down because an absent socket is then the client's _cue to start one_,
not a fault; disabling the daemon there would permanently defeat the only launcher those
machines have. atuin's own health-checking is what covers them — and that is now **measured
rather than assumed** (`dotgibson/dotfiles-core#402`). It is a second premise with its own
mode, its own anchor line in `zsh/00-tools.zsh` and its own issue title:
`scripts/verify-atuin-guard.sh --premise autostart` (or `make verify-atuin-guard-autostart`)
spawns a real daemon, checks that one appears and that the entry lands from each unreachable
shape, and proves the teardown before deleting anything. The weekly workflow runs it as a
separate job from the silent-discard one.

Two things that measurement established on 18.19.0, both worth knowing before you touch these
rows. The **stale-socket shape is the load-bearing one** — every `atuin history start` is a
fresh process, so "fire-and-forget" can only mean that a crashed daemon's leftover inode
defeats the spawn, and a check that only tried an absent socket would miss it. And the healing
lives in the **client**: `atuin daemon start` on its own refuses over a stale inode with
`Address already in use`, while the autostart path unlinks it first.

Still not covered, so the default `--premise discard` caveats are not the only ones: the
scheduled job runs on glibc Linux, which is neither of the two machines this premise protects,
and a run that is green there is the weakest evidence in the whole arrangement for these rows.
Running `make verify-atuin-guard-autostart` on the Alpine or macOS box itself is what actually
speaks for it.

The probe's limit, because it decides which unit you should install: it cannot tell an
**accept-but-silent** socket from a healthy one. systemd **socket activation** produces
exactly that state when the daemon behind the socket is dead — the socket keeps accepting,
the client waits, and that is the indefinite freeze in `atuinsh/atuin#3382`. Prefer the plain
always-running service above; if you do use a `.socket` unit with `systemd_socket = true`,
you are outside what Core can protect.

²¹ **Available, not installed** — the same shape as `jnv`¹⁷ and `gping`¹⁹, and the
counterpart to ³. These cells name where the tool comes from **when you opt in**, so on
the repos that do not carry it Core lights the `HAVE_*` probe only once you install it
yourself. That promise now actually holds for a `cargo install`, which is what #425 fixed:
`${CARGO_HOME:-~/.cargo}/bin` used to reach PATH via the OS layer at band 80, a whole
load-order band after `00-tools.zsh` probed, so the flag stayed dark and the alias was never
made while `core-doctor` — probing live, later — reported the tool present. It joins PATH
before detection now.

**Coverage here is per tool, never a fleet-wide zero** — the table below is the authority, not
the prose. **Two** repos' `bootstrap.sh` really do install entries from this family:
`dotfiles-Alpine` (`ouch` and `jnv`¹⁷, via cargo¹⁴) and `dotfiles-Gentoo` (`shfmt`
unconditionally via `go`; `ouch`, `ast-grep`¹¹, `jnv`¹⁷ and `watchexec`²⁵ via cargo, plus
`dev-vcs/jj`⁸ via emerge, all in an opt-in extras block that `--no-extras` skips; and `gping`¹⁹
via GURU). For the other seven repos "no bootstrap installs it" still holds.

**How the Gentoo half of that went unnoticed is the lesson worth keeping:** this table was
previously verified against each repo's `install/packages.txt` **alone**, and Gentoo is the repo
that installs the most from `bootstrap.sh` instead — deliberately, because `packages.txt` is its
UNCONDITIONAL emerge and everything opt-in must therefore live in the script. Verified against
`packages.txt`, four of the eight Gentoo cells below read `—` when bootstrap installs the tool.
**Check both files, or this row goes stale again.**

Verified 2026-08-21 (Gentoo column re-verified against `bootstrap.sh` as well) against all six
Linux repos plus the MacBook `Brewfile` — a **—** means detect-only there, and the packaged name
in that tool's row above is what you would install by hand rather than what a bootstrap gives
you:

| Tool           | macOS `Brewfile` | Alpine             | Gentoo                                    | Arch / Debian / Fedora / openSUSE |

- "extras" above means Gentoo's opt-in block: installed by default, **skipped by
  `--no-extras`**. That flag is the one thing keeping these honest as ²¹ entries rather than ³
  ones — the tool is still something you can decline.
- This list used to read "**macOS-only in practice**: the MacBook `Brewfile` carries them;
  **no** Linux repo does." Every row above falsifies that — Alpine carries seven of the eight
  outright and Gentoo installs all eight, four of them from `bootstrap.sh`. Keep it a **per-tool**
  statement: the family is defined by "Core probes it, and most repos leave installing it to
  you", not by a distro, and no longer by "no bootstrap installs it" — two now do.
  (Deliberately not a counted list — "all four" went stale the first time this family grew,
  "no Linux repo does" the second, and "`ouch` is the one entry" the third.)
- The cells that previously showed **³** here — `ouch` on Gentoo **and** Kali, `jujutsu` on
  Kali, `ast-grep` on Gentoo **and** Kali, `shfmt` on Gentoo, `lazygit` on Kali — promised a
  best-effort bootstrap install that **does not exist**, verified against each repo's
  `bootstrap.sh` and `install/packages.txt`. (Gentoo's `ouch`, `ast-grep` and `shfmt` have since
  _acquired_ such an install, and `jujutsu` on Gentoo is now the packaged `dev-vcs/jj`⁸ — the
  correction stands for Kali, and for what those cells claimed when it was made.) `lazygit` is the sharpest case: every other Linux repo installs it,
  Kali installs it nowhere, and Core ships `alias lg='lazygit'` regardless.
- **Kali installs nothing from this family**, `ast-grep` included. This note used to carve out
  an exception saying it did — "`bootstrap.sh`, cargo best-effort" — and that is why the
  `ast-grep` row kept a `³` in its Kali cell after its neighbours lost theirs. There is no such
  install: `dotfiles-Offense`'s `bootstrap.sh` contains no `ast-grep`, and its only two `cargo`
  mentions are the comment and `export` that put `~/.cargo/bin` on PATH for tools **an operator
  added by hand** — which is the ²¹ contract, not a ³ one. The cell is now `cargo²¹`, matching
  `ouch` and `jujutsu` in the same column.

This is the same overclaim already corrected once for openSUSE (`ouch`/`ast-grep`): ³ means
"bootstrap.sh installs it best-effort", so a ³ with no installer behind it reads as "you
have this" when you do not.

²² sd **changed its default in 1.1.0**: it now processes input **line by line**, and the old
whole-file behaviour moved behind `--across` / `-A`. The failure mode is **silent** — a pattern
that spans a newline (`sd 'foo\nbar' baz`) matches nothing, leaves the input unchanged, and
still **exits 0**, so a script carries on as though it had rewritten the file. Confirmed
behaviourally here rather than taken from the release notes. Worse, **`sd --version` cannot
tell you which behaviour you have** — the Homebrew 1.1.0 build self-reports `sd 1.0.0` — so
version sniffing is useless and a `HAVE_SD` version gate is not an option. Probe the flag
instead: `sd --help | grep -q -- --across`. Core itself is **unaffected**: `sd` is detect-only
(`HAVE_SD` in `zsh/00-tools.zsh`) with deliberately no alias (`zsh/20-aliases.zsh` — never
shadow `sed` in scripts), and nothing in Core shells out to it. This is a warning for muscle
memory and for the role layers.

Do **not** blanket-add `-A` to role scripts. The flag does not exist before 1.1.0, and this
matrix exists precisely because distros lag (Gentoo takes `sd` from the GURU overlay), so a
script that hard-codes it **breaks on the older build** — which already matches whole-file
and needs no flag. A script that must run against both feature-detects and builds the flag
list, rather than assuming either default:

```sh
sd_across=(); sd --help 2>/dev/null | grep -q -- --across && sd_across=(-A)
sd "${sd_across[@]}" 'foo\nbar' baz file
```

²³ Arch `refresh` (the **Package-manager commands** table above) is listed for
completeness — **`dotfiles-Arch` deliberately ships no alias for it.** A bare
`pacman -Sy` is safe on its own, but refreshing the sync DB and then installing is
the partial-upgrade footgun, so `os/arch.zsh` provides only `pacu` (a full `-Syu`)
and `pacout` (`checkupdates`, which lists updates without touching the sync DB at
all). There is no `-Sy <pkg>` alias **on purpose** — see "Distro quirks" below. Do
not "helpfully" add one.

²⁴ lnav: OPT-IN log reader — the verb Core had no tool for. `bat`/`rg` read a log as
**lines**, `jq`/`gron`/`jnv` read it as **JSON**, `glow` as markdown; `lnav` reads it as a
**log**: it autodetects common formats, merges several files into one timeline ordered by
timestamp, follows like `tail -f`, and exposes the parsed records to SQL. Its own command
(no alias, like `jq`/`gron`/`jnv`), `HAVE_LNAV`-guarded in `zsh/00-tools.zsh`, inert
without the binary. A **C++** CLI, so it has no `cargo`/`go install` escape hatch like the
Rust/Go tools above — but it does not need one: upstream publishes **static musl binaries**
per release (`lnav-0.14.0-linux-musl-x86_64.zip`, and an `arm64` twin), so the fallback on
an unpackaged or lagging box is "unzip the official build", not "compile it". That is also
the cleanest way to get 0.14.0 onto Gentoo or Debian/Kali without waiting for the package.
**No `bootstrap.sh` installs it anywhere**, but it is not detect-only across the board:
`dotfiles-Alpine` (`lnav`) and `dotfiles-Gentoo` (`app-admin/lnav`) both carry it in
`install/packages.txt`, and the MacBook `Brewfile` has it too (added 2026-07-15). On the other
four Linux repos Core lights `HAVE_LNAV` only once you install it yourself. So `lnav` sits in
²¹'s family — probed but never bootstrap-installed — rather than jnv's thinner "two platforms
package it, cargo everywhere else" one: every distro in the table above ships lnav, and two of
the repos ask for it.

Versions **verified against each distro's own package pages** on 2026-08-12, not taken from
a repology snapshot. Upstream is 0.14.0 (2026-04-12). Rolling targets get one query each,
because that query is the complete answer; **Fedora is versioned, so every supported stable
release is named separately** rather than collapsed into one unqualified ✓:

| Target          | Release                                  | lnav              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Arch            | `extra` (rolling)                        | 0.14.0-1          |
| openSUSE        | Tumbleweed (rolling)                     | 0.14.0            |
| Alpine          | `edge/community` — **native musl build** | 0.14.0-r0         |
| Homebrew        | rolling                                  | 0.14.0            |
| **Fedora**      | **Rawhide / F45**                        | **0.14.0-3.fc45** |
| **Fedora**      | **F44**                                  | **0.13.2-2.fc44** |
| **Fedora**      | **F43**                                  | **0.12.4-2.fc43** |
| **Kali/Debian** | rolling / sid                            | **0.13.2**        |
| **Gentoo**      | `app-admin/lnav`                         | **0.11.2**        |

So "Fedora has it" is true but "Fedora is current" is only true on F45/Rawhide — F44 and F43
track one and two minors back respectively. Two targets lag enough to be worth naming:

- **Gentoo `app-admin/lnav` is 0.11.2** — the only version in the tree, stable on amd64/x86,
  and the package is flagged as **needing a new maintainer**, so do not expect it to close
  the gap on its own. Three minor releases behind. Re-check on the next Gentoo stamp.
- **Kali/Debian `lnav` is 0.13.2** — one minor behind, the smaller gap of the two.

On either, the upstream static musl zip above is the way to 0.14.0 without waiting.

²⁵ watchexec: OPT-IN **event**-driven repetition — the third corner of a triangle Core
already had two of. `viddy` re-runs on a **timer** (`watch`), `hyperfine` re-runs a fixed
**count** and measures; `watchexec` re-runs when **files change** (`watchexec -e py --
pytest`). Its own command, `HAVE_WATCHEXEC`-guarded in `zsh/00-tools.zsh`, inert without
the binary. Deliberately **not** aliased to `watch` — `zsh/20-aliases.zsh` already points
`watch` at `viddy`, and collapsing "re-run on a timer" into "re-run on a change" would
silently hand you the wrong one.

**The one tool in ²¹'s family that inverts it: macOS is the machine that doesn't get it.**
The MacBook `Brewfile` does not carry `watchexec` — the only ²¹ entry it skips — while
`dotfiles-Alpine`'s `install/packages.txt` carries it outright and `dotfiles-Gentoo`
cargo-installs it from the extras block. The other seven machines are opt-in.
(This paragraph used to read "the only tool in this table that nothing in the fleet installs,
including macOS"; Alpine falsified the first half, and Gentoo — checked against `bootstrap.sh`
rather than `packages.txt` alone — falsified what was left of it.) Availability, verified
2026-08-12, Linux-repo coverage re-verified 2026-08-21 against both files:

- **Arch `extra`, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Homebrew, nixpkgs** — 2.5.1, current.
- **Alpine `community`** — 2.5.1-r0, a native musl build.
- **Gentoo: GURU carries 2.5.0**, and there is no `::gentoo` atom — but the cell reads
  `cargo²⁵`, not `GURU`, because `dotfiles-Gentoo` does not emerge that atom: it
  `cargo install`s `watchexec-cli` in its opt-in extras block instead, for upstream-latest.
  That is why this is **not** in ¹²'s GURU list — that footnote enumerates what the
  `guru_install` pass actually emerges. It is **no longer** the same shape as `gping`¹⁹,
  which _is_ emerged from GURU; watchexec is now the one GURU-available tool the Gentoo
  bootstrap deliberately routes around.
- **Fedora and Debian/Kali do not package it at all** (confirmed: Fedora's package search
  returns no results across F43/44/45/Rawhide/EPEL). Those two take
  `cargo install --locked watchexec-cli` — note the crate is **`watchexec-cli`**; plain
  `watchexec` on crates.io is the library, and installing that gives you no binary.

Do **not** read **Kali's** `cargo` cell as a `³`: no `bootstrap.sh` installs it there.
**Gentoo's `cargo` cell is the exception** — its bootstrap does install `watchexec-cli`, in
the opt-in extras block `--no-extras` skips. Either way `maint/dotfiles-maint.sh` runs
`rustup update` but has no `cargo install-update` step, so a `cargo`-installed `watchexec`
is never refreshed by the maintenance job — which bites the Gentoo box too, bootstrap or
not. That is already true of `ouch`/`jj`/`ast-grep` — a documentation gap this footnote
records rather than a new one.

²⁶ git-absorb: OPT-IN — works out which earlier commit each **staged hunk** belongs to and
writes the `fixup!` commits for you; `git rebase -i --autosquash` then folds them in, and
`git/gitconfig` already sets `rebase.autosquash = true`, so the second half is automatic.
It is the **automatic** counterpart to `git fix` (`commit --fixup`, `git/gitconfig`'s
`[alias]` block), which is the **manual** form: with `git fix <sha>` you name the target
commit yourself, and `git absorb` works one out per hunk. Reach for `git fix` when you know
where a change belongs and `git absorb` when you would otherwise go looking.

**The house-style ideal for a new tool: it needs no alias at all.** git-absorb installs as
`git-absorb` — on `PATH` in the common case, in git's exec-path on the Debian family (see
below) — and git dispatches it as the `git absorb` subcommand either way, so it shadows
nothing classic and `zsh/20-aliases.zsh` gains no entry, only a note saying why.
`HAVE_GIT_ABSORB` is set for symmetry with the other detected tools and **has no consumer
today** — `core-doctor` probes the tool itself rather than reading the flag, so the two are
independent paths to the same question and are kept in agreement deliberately (#425).
**Debian-family packages do install it into git's exec-path rather than onto `PATH`** — on
the two boxes anyone has actually checked. **Kali**, `git-absorb` 0.6.17-2+b4, verified
2026-08-17: `dpkg -L git-absorb` lists `/usr/lib/git-core/git-absorb` and a man page and
nothing else, `command -v git-absorb` finds nothing, and `git absorb --version` works.
**Ubuntu 24.04**, 0.6.11, from the reporter's `dpkg -L` in #424. **Debian proper is
unverified** — its package page lists 0.9.0-2 and nobody has looked at where that build
lands, so read the heading as the packaging convention plus two confirmations of it, not as
a survey of the family. The convention itself is standard for a `git-<verb>` subcommand and
not an oddity: git finds it via `--exec-path`, the user invokes it as `git absorb`, and it
is intentionally absent from `PATH`.

This paragraph used to say no mainstream package did that, and #424 is what the wrong claim
cost — `core-doctor` reported `✗ git-absorb` on boxes where the tool was installed and the
only supported way to call it worked, so a reader would go install what they already had.
Both sides now look past `PATH`:

- `core-doctor` resolves any `git-*` row through `git --exec-path` when the bare name misses
  (`zsh/30-functions.zsh`, `_core_git_exec_path` + the `git-*` arm of `_core_doctor_bin`).
  One fork, only on a miss, cached per report, and the resolved absolute path is what the
  `-v` version readout then executes.
- `HAVE_GIT_ABSORB` falls back to a **zero-fork** stat. An **exported** `$GIT_EXEC_PATH` is
  probed **exclusively**, because that is what it means to git — it replaces the compiled-in
  exec-path rather than adding to it, and an _unexported_ parameter of that name never
  reaches git at all, so it is ignored here too. With no such override it stats
  `<git-prefix>/{lib,libexec}/git-core`, the prefix derived from zsh's builtin `$commands`
  hash rather than hard-coded. `zsh/00-tools.zsh` still forks nothing at shell start, which
  is the constraint that made the original PATH-only probe look reasonable.

Where the two can still differ: a git built with its libexec outside its own prefix, with
the subcommand not linked onto `PATH`. `core-doctor` is authoritative there — it asks git —
and the flag is a best-effort approximation.

Arch, Alpine, Gentoo and Homebrew land the binary on `PATH` (Homebrew in its own prefix
`bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple silicon and `/usr/local/bin` on Intel), so those boxes
never reach the fallback — but that is package-page evidence, not an on-box check, so treat
it with the same caution as the version stamps below.

**No `bootstrap.sh` installs it**, and it is packaged essentially everywhere — the ²¹ shape,
not `jnv`¹⁷'s. The MacBook `Brewfile` carries it, and so do `dotfiles-Alpine`
(`git-absorb`) and `dotfiles-Gentoo` (`dev-vcs/git-absorb`) in their `install/packages.txt`;
the other four Linux repos are detect-only (re-verified 2026-08-21). Package versions verified
2026-08-12 against each distro's own package pages:

- **Arch `extra`** 0.9.0-2, **Alpine `community`** 0.9.0-r0, **Gentoo `dev-vcs/git-absorb`**
  0.9.0 (**stable on amd64**, in the main tree — no GURU needed), **Homebrew** 0.9.0.
- **Debian `git-absorb`** 0.9.0-2 per packages.debian.org, but **Kali rolling ships
  0.6.17-2+b4** — verified on-box 2026-08-17. The two now have their own columns above, and
  this is a case where that matters: Kali is a laggard here rather than a Debian follower.
  Whether Debian's own 0.9.0-2 also installs into git's exec-path is **not** verified — only
  the Kali build is, so the ²⁶ footnote's on-box evidence covers the Kali column. Note repology
  reports the **source** package as `rust-git-absorb`; the **binary** package you install is
  `git-absorb`, confirmed on packages.debian.org. Fedora is the same shape
  (`rust-git-absorb` source, `git-absorb` binary).
- **openSUSE Tumbleweed is the other laggard, also at 0.6.17** — the gap #394 flagged,
  confirmed here rather than left as a repology snapshot. Re-check on the next openSUSE
  stamp.

²⁷ carapace: **`go install` cannot work here, on any platform, for any published version.**
This row used to read `go³`, and following that footnote fails on every box. It is the one
row where ³'s `go install` arm is not merely stale but impossible, so it gets its own paths.
Two independent blockers, both **properties of how the module is built** rather than a broken
build waiting to be fixed:

1. `carapace-bin`'s `go.mod` carries two **`replace`** directives (`spf13/pflag` →
   `carapace-sh/carapace-pflag`, `kevinburke/ssh_config` → `carapace-sh/ssh_config`), and
   `go install pkg@version` refuses any module that does — a `replace` would make the build
   differ from building that module as the main module: _"The go.mod file for the module
   providing named packages contains one or more replace directives. It must not contain
   directives that would cause it to be interpreted differently than if it were the main
   module."_
2. The **generated sources are not committed**: `pkg/actions/actions_generated.go` and
   `pkg/conditions/conditions_generated.go` are absent from a fresh clone, and
   `cmd/carapace/main.go`'s `go:generate` lines produce them.

Blocker 1 kills `go install`; blocker 2 kills the obvious workaround (`go build ./cmd/carapace`
on a clone) until `go generate` has run.

**The scope is every version, not just the current one** — which matters, because `go install`
takes any `@version` you name and the obvious next move on a failure is to pin an older one.
Don't: it fails identically. Checked exhaustively over the whole tag history on 2026-08-15
(`git clone --bare --filter=blob:none`, then `git show <tag>:go.mod` for each of the 184 tags
from **v0.0.3, 2020-08-31, through v1.7.3, 2026-06-30**):

- **184 of 184 tags carry a `replace` directive.** Zero exceptions. The count rose from one to
  two at v1.6.0, which is immaterial — one is enough.
- **0 of 184 tags commit `pkg/actions/actions_generated.go`.** It has never been in the tree.

So this is not an extrapolation from the current release: in nearly six years of tags there has
never been a version you could `go install`. Upstream's own `.goreleaser.yml` runs
`go generate ./cmd/...` as a pre-build hook and the AUR's from-source `carapace` PKGBUILD does
the same — this is the intended build shape, not an oversight. Upstream _could_ drop the
`replace` directives or start committing the generated sources in a future release, and this
row can be revisited if they do, but that would reverse six years of practice: treat it as a
change to watch for, not one to assume. **Re-check only on an announced change, and verify
with an actual `go install` before believing it.**

**The route is the upstream release artifact**, which goreleaser publishes per arch as
`.rpm`, `.deb`, `.apk` and `.tar.gz` (v1.7.3, 2026-06-30). Per target:

- **openSUSE** — the `linux_<arch>.rpm`. This is exactly the route `dotfiles-Fedora`'s
  `bootstrap.sh` already ships and has proven end-to-end; port that block, don't re-derive
  it. One difference from dnf that will bite: **upstream signs nothing** (there is no `signs:`
  stanza in `.goreleaser.yml`), and while dnf4 installs an unsigned local/URL rpm without
  complaint, `zypper -n` aborts on one — so a non-interactive install needs
  `--no-gpg-checks`. Same shape for Alpine's `.apk` (`--allow-untrusted`) if you ever need it.

  Be clear-eyed about what that flag gives up rather than pasting it as boilerplate: with no
  signature to check, **the only trust anchor left is HTTPS to the GitHub release origin**,
  and you are installing as root. Upstream does publish a `checksums.txt`, but it is
  unsigned and served from the same origin as the asset — it catches a truncated or corrupted
  download, not a compromised release, so it is not a substitute for a signature. A repo that
  wants a real anchor should pin the version and record the SHA-256 **in its own tree**, which
  is precisely the shape `scripts/tool-versions.env` + `scripts/update-tool-checksums.sh`
  already use for the gate toolchain (`.github/actions/setup-core-tools` verifies before
  installing). That is a heavier contract than any other bootstrap-installed tool carries
  today — starship and atuin come from upstream installer scripts, which verify less — so it
  is a deliberate per-repo call, not something this row silently mandates.
- **Kali/Debian** — the `linux_<arch>.deb`, same asset set (`amd64`/`arm64`). `apt-get
  install` wants a path, not a URL, so this is curl-to-a-tempfile then `apt-get install
  ./carapace-bin_*.deb` (which resolves deps, unlike bare `dpkg -i`).
- **Arch** — the AUR, and the package name matters: **`carapace-bin`** (1.7.3-1, `provides`/
  `conflicts` `carapace`, covers x86_64/aarch64/i686) just unpacks the upstream tarball, while
  the AUR also carries a from-source **`carapace`** that is x86_64-only and needs a Go
  toolchain. Prefer `paru -S carapace-bin`. Note the same exception ¹⁶ records for viddy:
  `dotfiles-Arch`'s bootstrap builds no AUR helper, so on a bare box this is a manual step —
  or lift the binary straight out of the upstream `.tar.gz` into `~/.local/bin`.
- **Alpine (`carapace`, `community`) and Gentoo (`app-shells/carapace`, GURU per ¹²) need no
  fallback at all** — both are genuinely packaged and both bootstraps install them. Those two
  cells carry no ²⁷ because they are verified fine, not because they were skipped.

**What the release-URL route costs you, stated plainly:** installing from a release URL adds
no repo, so **nothing upgrades carapace afterwards** — not `zypper dup`/`apt upgrade`, not
`maint/dotfiles-maint.sh`, and not a later bootstrap either (a `command -v carapace` guard
short-circuits the whole block once the binary exists). Upstream ships no rpm/apt repo and
neither distro packages it, so there is no upgrade source to point at; updating is a
deliberate manual step and `carapace --version` is how you would know you are behind. That is
the real cost, and it is still the right trade: `go install` cannot work at all, so the choice
is a manually-updated binary or no carapace. Arch is the exception — `carapace-bin` from the
AUR is a normal package that `paru -Syu` refreshes.

**Building from source** is the escape hatch for an arch with no published artifact. Verified
end-to-end in #416:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace-bin.git
cd carapace-bin
go generate ./cmd/...                          # writes the *_generated.go files
go build -o ~/.local/bin/carapace ./cmd/carapace
```

Two caveats. **Size:** this is a big binary either way — 500+ bundled completers put
upstream's released amd64 build at **81.6 MB on disk** (from a ~14 MiB download), and a plain
`go build` lands nearer 114 MB because it is unstripped and skips upstream's `-tags release`;
add `-ldflags='-s -w' -tags release` to close most of the gap. **Version:** the build will
self-report `carapace-bin develop` no matter what you clone. That is **not** a shallow-clone
artifact, as it first appears — `cmd/carapace/main.go` initializes `var version = "develop"`
and nothing in the build derives it from git, so a full clone and a checked-out tag report
`develop` too. The version is injected at link time or not at all; pass it yourself, as both
upstream's goreleaser and the AUR PKGBUILD do:
`-ldflags="-s -w -X main.version=v<tag>"`.

Core's side is unchanged by any of this: `zsh/00-tools.zsh` sets `HAVE_CARAPACE`, and
`zsh/45-plugins.zsh` runs `carapace _carapace zsh` through `_cache_eval` **after** `compinit`
(`zsh/10-options.zsh`), feeding fzf-tab. Inert without the binary.

**Three OS repos still call the impossible `go install`** and have been failing invisibly at
it, because `_dotfiles_go_install` sends the explanation to `/dev/null` and downgrades the
failure to a deferred note: `dotfiles-Arch/bootstrap.sh`, `dotfiles-Offense/bootstrap.sh` and
`dotfiles-openSUSE/bootstrap.sh`. Each is tracked in its own repo; this footnote is the
contract they should be fixed against.

²⁸ **Debian/Ubuntu — pinned upstream release asset.** `dotfiles-Debian` installs this
from a version- and SHA-256-pinned GitHub release asset via `bootstrap.sh`'s
`verified_install` (pins in its `install/tool-versions.env`, refreshed by
`scripts/update-tool-checksums.sh`), because Ubuntu 24.04 either has no package at all
or has one below the version Core needs. It is fail-closed: a missing pin, failed
download, or hash mismatch skips that tool loudly rather than installing anything
unverified. **Neovim is the exception in shape** — its asset is a directory tree
(`bin/` + `lib/` + `share/nvim/runtime`), so it uses `verified_tree_install` and lands
in `~/.local/opt` with a symlink into `~/.local/bin`; copying the bare binary yields an
editor whose `$VIMRUNTIME` points at nothing. Deliberately _not_ the AppImage: Ubuntu
24.04 sets `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`, which blocks the
unprivileged user namespace an AppImage needs to mount itself.

²⁹ **Not installed on `dotfiles-Debian`.** Unlike a `³`/`cargo³` cell, this is not "you
install it by hand" — it is a decision. `yazi`, `viddy` and `ast-grep` are cargo-only and
noble's rustc is **1.75**, too old to build them; shipping a toolchain that fails
halfway through a long build is worse than not shipping the tool. `jnv`, `ouch`,
`jujutsu` and `watchexec` are likewise unpackaged there and not worth a hand-maintained
pin. All are `HAVE_*`-guarded in Core, so the shell degrades cleanly. Want one on a
particular box? `mise use -g rust`, then `cargo install --locked <tool>` — and as of #425
the next login picks it up on its own, no symlink into `~/.local/bin` needed.

³⁰ **`mise` and `uv` — the two the doctor probes but this table used to omit.**
`core-doctor` reports on both (`_CORE_DOCTOR_GROUPS` in `zsh/30-functions.zsh`) and both
get a `HAVE_*` flag, so a `✗` for either sent the reader to a matrix with no row to find —
the one promise `zsh/30-functions.zsh`'s "install missing" hint makes. **`mise` is the
chicken-and-egg row**: footnotes ¹, ⁶, ⁷, ¹⁰, ¹¹ and ²⁹ all prescribe `mise use -g <x>` as
a fallback, and every `bootstrap.sh` reaches for `mise exec go@latest` when no Go toolchain
is present, so it is a prerequisite of this table rather than an entry in it. Only **Arch**
packages it (`extra`); openSUSE, Gentoo and Kali have none, and the bootstraps there use the
official installer (`curl -fsSL https://mise.run | sh`, landing in `~/.local/bin`). Alpine
_does_ carry `mise` in `community`, but `dotfiles-Alpine` still takes `mise.run` for the musl
build — hence `script³⁰`, not a package name, in that cell.

`uv` is the cleanest illustration of why the Kali and Debian/Ubuntu columns had to be split
at all (`dotgibson/dotfiles-core#431`): **kali-rolling ships `uv` 0.9.17 and Ubuntu 24.04
ships nothing**, because uv reached Debian only in sid/trixie. `dotfiles-Debian` therefore
pins it as a `verified_install` asset ²⁸. openSUSE's is named `python-uv` (Tumbleweed — Leap
was not separately audited, so verify with `zypper se python-uv` and fall back to ³ there),
and Gentoo's is `dev-python/uv`, not a bare `uv`.

**mise also appears in this table as a _provider_, in exactly one cell: `gum` on Gentoo.**
Charm's gum is packaged nowhere Portage can reach — not `::gentoo`, not GURU, in any category
(see ¹²) — so `dotfiles-Gentoo` declares it in `gentoo/mise-tools.toml`, which mise installs as
a prebuilt, checksum-verified binary with no compiler and no privileges. **Read that cell with
one caveat:** that manifest is installed only on the **`--user`** (no-root) path, so a
_privileged_ Gentoo bootstrap installs no gum at all. On that path it is a hand-install —
`mise use -g gum`, or `go install charm.land/gum/v2@latest` (the module path, **not** the
GitHub URL — see ³¹).

³¹ **`go install` module paths — the repo URL is usually NOT the module path.** Four of the
six go-installable rows need a major-version suffix, a `cmd/` subpath, or both, and a naive
`go install github.com/<org>/<repo>@latest` fails or silently builds an abandoned major.
Verified against each project's own `go.mod`, and these are the exact strings the fleet's
`bootstrap.sh` files already pass to `_dotfiles_go_install`:

| Tool    | `go install <path>@latest`            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `doggo` | `github.com/mr-karan/doggo/cmd/doggo` |
| `sesh`  | `github.com/joshmedeski/sesh/v2`      |
| `yq`    | `github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4`          |
| `shfmt` | `mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt`            |
| `gron`  | `github.com/tomnomnom/gron`           |

**Charm's tools moved off GitHub as a module host** — `glow` is now `charm.land/glow/v3`
(v3.0.0, 2026-08-11) and `gum` is `charm.land/gum/v2` (v2.0.0). Both still _live_ on GitHub;
only the module path changed. #431 reported `github.com/charmbracelet/glow/v2`, which was
right when it was filed and is now two majors stale — a good reason to re-read `go.mod`
rather than trust a remembered path. Neither is go-installed by any `bootstrap.sh` today
(the Debian/Kali cells use Charm's apt repo, see ¹⁵), so these two are for the reader
installing by hand.

³² direnv: per-directory environment loader — **Core wires it but neither installs nor
detects it.** There is no `HAVE_DIRENV`, no alias and no `core-doctor` row: `_cache_eval`
already bails on an absent binary, so the hook needs no flag to guard it. Since **v4.14.1**
the `direnv hook zsh` that makes it work lives in Core, at `zsh/00-tools.zsh` **band 00**,
where #449 pulled seven byte-drifted `os/*.zsh` copies up into one. Band 00 and not 45 with
the gh/uv/ty completions, because this registers a hook rather than a compdef and band 00
loads under every `CORE_PROFILE` while 45 is ceilinged out of `minimal`; filed under 45 it
would silently stop `.envrc` files loading on minimal hosts. It is sourced **last** of the
four inits on purpose: direnv prepends `_direnv_hook` to `precmd_functions` and
`chpwd_functions`, so sourcing it after mise reproduces the order these hooks had at band 80
— direnv's per-directory env resolves before mise's, which is what an `.envrc` that pins tool
versions expects. An OS repo that still carries the old band-80 block is harmless but
redundant, and drops out on its next Core sync.

Core's other stake is `starship/starship.toml`'s **`[direnv]` module**, which Core switches on
(`disabled = false`; starship ships this module **off** by default): it renders `.envrc` state
on the `srf1` band so a directory waiting on `direnv allow` is visible rather than silently
unloaded. The module only draws inside a direnv-controlled tree, so a box without the binary
loses a segment, not the prompt.

**Installed, not merely available** — the inverse of ²¹. Six of the seven package lists carry
it outright (`dotfiles-Arch`, `-openSUSE`, `-Alpine`, `-Debian`, `-Fedora`, and the MacBook
`Brewfile`), and `dotfiles-Gentoo` emerges `app-shells/direnv` in its `guru_install` pass per
¹². **`dotfiles-Offense` (Kali) is the single gap, and it is structural rather than a call
about direnv**: that repo carries no `install/packages.txt`, so nothing there installs the
package. It does now get the **hook** — that arrives from Core at band 00 like everywhere
else, which is a change from the band-80 arrangement, where Offense missed it too for having
no `os/` layer at all. So the hook is live there and simply finds no binary. The Kali cell
above is the apt name you would install by hand.

Verified 2026-08-21 against each distro's own index: **Arch `extra`** 2.37.1-1, **Alpine
`community`** 2.37.1-r7 (v3.24 — a Go binary, so a native musl build), **openSUSE** Tumbleweed
2.37.1 with **Leap 16.0 and 16.1 both at 2.34.0** through Backports (`bp160.1.13` /
`bp161.1.9`, both arches), **kali-rolling** 2.37.1-1, **Ubuntu 24.04 `universe`**
2.32.1-2ubuntu0.24.04.3 and **Debian trixie** 2.32.1-2+b16. **Gentoo is GURU-only** — 2.37.1,
`~amd64 ~x86`, no `::gentoo` atom and no `dev-util/direnv`; see ¹². Where unpackaged, the
module path is `github.com/direnv/direnv/v2` — the `/v2` is not optional, the ³¹ trap again.

One version line, because it is the only place a frozen archive touches Core: starship runs
`direnv status --json`, and **the `--json` flag is silently ignored below direnv 2.33.0** —
starship's own `src/modules/direnv.rs` says exactly that and falls back to parsing the text
output. Every target above clears that floor except `dotfiles-Debian`'s two lanes, both on
2.32.1. It degrades rather than breaks, which is why that repo's `install/packages.txt`
declares no `# min:` floor for it.

## Clipboard packages to install (backends for Core's `clip`)

<!-- Clipboard selection lives in Core's cross-OS clip/clip-paste scripts; each
     os/<distro>.zsh only aliases pbcopy/pbpaste to them — no distro swaps a
     backend in its zsh layer. This table is the packages each backend needs. -->

## Distro quirks worth a README note (and that will actually bite you)

**Arch** — Rolling release; update often or not at all (partial upgrades break
things — never `-Sy <pkg>` without `-u`). Most modern tools are in official
repos; the rest are one `paru -S` away in the AUR. Enable `multilib` if you'll
run 32-bit/Wine tooling. Cleanest distro for this stack.

**openSUSE** — Two flavors, and the update command differs: **Tumbleweed**
(rolling) uses `zypper dup`, **Leap** (stable) uses `zypper up`. Get this wrong
and you either don't update or you half-update. Add the **Packman** repo (the
openSUSE analog to RPM Fusion) for codecs. `zypper` has the best dependency
solver of any of these — lean on it.

**Alpine** — The real outlier: **musl libc, not glibc.** Prebuilt binaries
linked against glibc (some `cargo`-less installer scripts, some vendor blobs)
**will not run** — prefer `apk` packages or musl-target builds. Default shell is
`ash` (busybox), default privilege tool is `doas` (not `sudo`), and many
"classic" commands are busybox applets with fewer flags. This is your
small-footprint / container / rescue-disk distro — keep its layer lean and don't
fight the musl grain.

**Gentoo** — Source-based: `emerge` **compiles** packages, so expect real build
time (mitigate with binary packages via a binhost, and tune `MAKEOPTS`). **USE
flags** gate features at compile time — this is the whole point of Gentoo and
where the learning is. Tool _names_ are full atoms (`category/name`). Treat this
repo as your "understand the system from the ground up" build; it's the most
educational and the most time-expensive.

**Offense (Kali / WSL2)** — The one repo that isn't stamped from Fedora: it's Debian-family
(apt) and carries a unique **offensive role layer** on top of the usual OS layer,
adding an `offensive` stage to the zsh loader (`… os offensive local`). Two things
actually bite. (1) Debian renames binaries — `bat`→`batcat`, and the `fd-find`
package installs `fdfind`; Core handles both. (2) **WSL2 is NAT'd**, so a listener
or reverse shell in Kali isn't reachable from your LAN until you enable **mirrored
networking** — which lives in the _Windows-side_ `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`
(`networkingMode=mirrored`, Win11 22H2+), **not** `/etc/wsl.conf`. Keep all
engagement data in `~/engagements` (outside the repo); the repo ships a paranoid
`.gitignore` as backup.

**Debian/Ubuntu** — the fleet's only **frozen** target, and that is the whole
character of the repo. `dotfiles-Debian` aims at **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (April 2024)
while proving `debian:trixie` in CI, so unlike every rolling sibling, "apt has it" is
not the same question as "apt has a version Core can use". Two packages resolve
perfectly and break the stack: **neovim** (noble 0.9.5 vs the 0.12 that
nvim-treesitter's `main` hard-requires) and **tree-sitter-cli** (noble 0.20.8 vs the
0.26.1 floor in footnote ⁵ — no Debian/Ubuntu suite short of sid clears it). Its
`install/packages.txt` therefore declares `# min:` floors that CI enforces, and a
dozen tools come from pinned upstream assets instead (²⁸). Three more traps:
**`yq`** in apt is kislyuk's _Python_ tool, and the Go build (`yq-go`) is sid-only, so
neither name is safe to list; **`cargo`** is 1.75, too old to build yazi/ast-grep/viddy,
which are simply not installed (²⁹); and **`needrestart`**, preinstalled on Ubuntu
Server, interposes on apt with a full-screen prompt that `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` does _not_
suppress — an unattended bootstrap over SSH hangs forever without `NEEDRESTART_MODE=a`.
Vendor-signed apt repos (Charm, 1Password) are used where upstream offers them; **PPAs
are not**, because they are keyed to an Ubuntu series and would break the Debian lane.

---

### Repo status

- **Built:** `core`, `Fedora` (template), `MacBook`, `Arch`, `Debian`, `openSUSE`,
  `Alpine`, `Gentoo`, `Offense`, `Defense`. That is the nine Core-vendoring repos
  (`scripts/os-repos.txt`) plus `core` itself; `Windows` vendors no `core/` and is
  tracked separately.
- **Stamp-pending (this doc):** none — all five template stamps are complete.
- `Offense` (apt + offensive layer) and `MacBook` (Homebrew) are their own lineages,
  built directly rather than stamped from Fedora. `Windows` is tracked separately
  from this matrix.
- **Role repos:** `Offense` (offensive) and `Defense` (defensive) both vendor
  Core. `Offense` also carries its own OS-native layer (Debian/apt, kali-rolling) —
  distinct from `dotfiles-Debian`, which targets a frozen Ubuntu LTS and carries no
  role layer. `Defense` is
  **distro-agnostic** — it stacks its blue-team stage on whatever OS-native layer is
  underneath — so it has no row in this OS-stamp matrix by design, not by omission.
  Both role repos source the shared bootstrap scaffold (`lib/bootstrap-lib.sh`) and
  call `blib_link_core` exactly as the OS repos do. Where they differ is the `80`
  band, which belongs to the OS repo underneath: the contract is that a role repo
  skips `blib_link_os_layer` and calls `blib_link_role_layer` instead, wiring the
  `85` band and `tmux/role.conf`. **Neither repo has adopted it yet** — `Defense`
  hand-rolls the band in its own `wire_defense_stage`, and `Offense` still calls
  `blib_link_os_layer` because it still carries the Kali OS layer. Both migrate
  once the Core release carrying the helper fans out. Deliberate, not drift —
  `core.manifest` records it too.
- `Debian` is stamped from Fedora structurally, but takes its **apt idioms** from
  `Offense` — the fleet's other Debian-family repo. It is the only **frozen** target
  (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS), which is why it carries by far the largest out-of-band install
  surface (²⁸) and the only version-floor gate in the fleet.

### Stamping order (all complete — kept as the recommended sequence for reference)

1. **Arch** ✓ — almost everything is in-repo; closest to Fedora effort.
2. **openSUSE** ✓ — straightforward once you internalize `dup` vs `up`.
3. **Alpine** ✓ — forces you to reason about musl and minimalism (great for the
   container/rescue skills a red-teamer wants).
4. **Gentoo** ✓ — the capstone; USE flags + source builds teach you the most.
5. **Debian/Ubuntu** ✓ — added last, and the one that breaks the pattern: the
   structure ports cleanly, but a frozen LTS means the interesting work is deciding
   what apt can honestly supply and pinning the rest. Read its `CLAUDE.md` before
   changing `install/packages.txt`.
